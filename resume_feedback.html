    <!-- A lot going on right here with your name.

         First, you want to contain your name, contact information in
         a header tag.

         'h#'' tags are headers, so there is a kind of emphasis 
         already associated with them - - they indicate the start of 
         a section of text. So including 'strong' is redundant.
    -->

  	<a id="top"><h1><strong>Joe Fiene</strong></h1></a>
    
    <!-- This not the way you want to use blockquote. It is
         a tag reserved for, well, quotes. It seems you used this
         for more of a visual purpose than to exhibit semantics.

         A 'p' would be just fine here.

         For the link to your email, nice work figuring that out.
         However, this is a way spammers harvest addresses. If you
         prefer, I've been allowing students to encode their
         address: http://hivelogic.com/enkoder/.

         Also, use of targets is something to think about. In
         this case, you may not need it since a 'mailto:' usually
         opens an email application. (Although it may, on some
         computers - - a Chromebook? - - open a web-based interface.
         Something for /me/ to think about.)

         But when linking offsite - - you can do it, but it tends to 
         indicate distrust in the user. Will they come back? Most 
         sites, when linking off site, do not have a new window/tab 
         open. Of course, this is a largely theoretical debate, but 
         worth noting for you to consider.

    <!-- use of 'hr' is fine, but remember you can control this 
         using CSS in the future
    -->

    <!-- Displaying the navigation as you did is fine, although it
         could be improved with an unordered list as was displayed
         in class - - it will make it easier to style in the future.

         Also, the values for each anchor are fine, but these also
         show up in a url bar when they are clicked:

         resume.html#skills

         That's kind of an added bonus for user interface and 
         experience. So, no, it's not wrong that you went with short
         values, but you could also benefit from having longer
         values, too! (If you decide to make a change, be sure to
         make the changes in your anchors, too.)

    <!-- div tags work, but in the case of this assignment I was

      <!-- The 'ins' tag is reserved for noting whether text has been 
           inserted into a document. (It's counterpart is the 'del' 
           tag.) The use of ins here doesn't really apply. The use of
           h3 is enough.

           For education, I kind of expected to see more of a list of
           your degree, minor, for instance:

           <h4>B.A. Computer Science</h4>
           <ul>
             <li><strong>University of Miami</strong>, 201X?</li>
             <li><em>Minor in Religious Studies</em></li>
           </ul>

           What you have here is more of a summary, and that's okay
           except I'd expect it under a header of 'Summary' or 'About'
           as opposed to say, 'Education.'

           Within a paragraph, it is not a good idea to break up the
           text. You want to let it flow as it would normally be
           rendered so when you apply styles the text adjusts within
           the area specified.

           I grasp what you're trying to do here - - keep the text
           from running across a big page, but that's something to
           worry about with styling.

           Where you indicate CBTO, that's a great opportunity to
           use the 'abbr' tag, even though you describe it. Remember,
           you are focusing on adding information about the content
           of your page.

      <!-- the validator expected a '/ul' tag here and that, I think is

           Good use of 'abbr' - - exactly what I was talking about 
           before. I don't believe it can hurt to have that in there
           multiple times. On a long, long document, maybe one-and-done

      <!-- Something above, more to just eliminate potential issues...
           keep the = snug against that href. It didn't break the
           links when I checked, and the validator did not see
           and issue either, but when working with scripting, that
           may be picky. 

           I understand why you added the non-breaking spaces, but 
           remember, styling will handle this down the line. On the
           plus side, you encoded them properly! On the down side
           you can eliminate them. 

           Another suggestion: for the file name and alt text, 
           perhaps you can be a little more descriptive with that. 
           For instance: "joe_fiene_business_card.png" and "Joe 
           Fiene's Business Card". 

           In the case of the filename, it is never bad to add
           context in case someone comes across the file accidentally
           without it being attached to the web page.

      <!-- nice idea here; resumes can get long, so always good to 
           provide means for someone to get back to the beginning

      -->

    <!-- Use of 'address' is good, but thumbs down on blockquote.

         Curious as to why the address is not higher. My first
         thought is that many early web pages done by CS people
         placed addresses at the bottom. But in the case of a resume
         this is some important information.

         Using 'br' is acceptable here! :)

         If you opt to keep it here, remember to enclose it in
         a section element. Or, better yet, you could even use
         a footer element.
